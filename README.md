# Sublime text 3 LaTeX snippets
This is a collection of snippets to be used in Sublime Text 3 to assist writing LaTex documents.
Most snippets currently available are a port of the snippets that can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) that were adapted to function in ST3.

Feel free to use this collection and even add to it if you find that there is something missing :)

I would like to thank [Honza](https://github.com/honza) for letting me do this project.
## How to install
1. Clone this repository or download the files as .zip

  * On Windows: ```C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages```
